Please refer to the attached datasets "train.csv" and "test.csv" and do feature engineering and pre-processing accordingly. The maximum number of features that you can have in the final datasets is limited to 20.

You are required to submit your answers as two CSV files named "index_lab1_train.csv" and "index_lab1_test.csv".

ex: 190001A_lab1_train.csv and 190001A_lab1_test.csv

A sample code (sample.ipynb) is added for your reference to get an idea about how you will be evaluated.
